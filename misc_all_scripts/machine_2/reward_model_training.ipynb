    "## Training Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was fine-tuned using the Hugging Face Transformers library with the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning rate: 2e-5\n",
    "- Batch size: 8\n",
    "- Number of epochs: 3\n",
    "- Warmup steps: 500\n",
    "- Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay of 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended Use\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is intended for research purposes to evaluate conversation quality and can be used as a reward model in RLHF training pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model may have biases inherited from the training data\n",
    "- Performance may vary on conversations significantly different from the training distribution\n",
    "- Should be used as part of a larger system rather than standalone decision-making\n",
